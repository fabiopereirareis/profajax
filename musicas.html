      <h2>Ambitionz az a Ridah</h2>
      <h3>Canção de Tupac Shakur</h3>
      I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah <br />
      You don't wanna fuck with me <br />
      Got the police bustin' at me <br />
      But they can't do nothin' to a G <br />
      Let's get ready to rumble! <br />
      Now, you know how we do it, like a G <br />
      What really go on in the mind of a nigga <br />
      That get down for theirs <br />
      Constantly, money over bitches <br />
      Not bitches over money <br />
      Stay on your grind, nigga <br />
      My ambitions as a ridah <br />
      My ambitions as a ridah <br />
      So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars <br />
      This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard <br />
      Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public <br />
      My attitude was fuck it, 'cause motherfuckers love it <br />
      To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease <br />
      Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be <br />
      Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah <br />
      To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her <br />
      Then I spit some game in her ear, go to the telly, hoe! <br />
      Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke <br />
      I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' Crucial <br />
      From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual <br />
      From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay up <br />
      I got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us
      <br />
      I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin' <br />
      Competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin' (Booyah)
      <br />
      I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory <br />
      No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted <br />
      Now it's on and it's on because I said so <br />
      Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row <br />
      Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious <br />
      Started plottin' and plannin' on schemes to come and trick us <br />
      But thug niggas be on point and game tight (Yeah) <br />
      Me, Syke and Bogart wrap it up the same night <br />
      Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me <br />
      These niggas is jealous <br />
      'Cause deep in the hearts they wanna be me <br />
      Uh, yeah, and now you got me right beside ya, hopin' you listen
      <br />
      I catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah <br />
      I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah <br />
      You don't wanna fuck with me <br />
      (My ambitions as a ridah) <br />
      Got the police bustin' at me <br />
      But they can't do nothin' to a G (I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah)
      <br />
      It was my only wish to rise <br />
      Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise <br />
      When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the 9
      <br />
      I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life <br />
      That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
      <br />
      So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel (That's all you niggas
      got?) <br />
      Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me <br />
      I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed <br />
      Mama, come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts <br />
      I'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught (Shoot)
      <br />
      Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice <br />
      Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tys <br />
      Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it <br />
      Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it <br />
      When it's time to die, to be a man and pick the way you leave <br />
      Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah <br />
      I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah <br />
      You don't wanna fuck with me <br />
      (My ambitions as a ridah) <br />
      Got the police bustin' at me <br />
      But they can't do nothin' to a G <br />
      My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
      <br />
      Pay off the block, evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
      <br />
      I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years <br />
      Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears <br />
      Question my methods to switch up speeds <br />
      Sure as some bitches bleed <br />
      Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed <br />
      Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers <br />
      So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace <br />
      They cowards, that's why they tried to set me up <br />
      Had bitch-ass niggas on my team so indeed they wet me up <br />
      But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated <br />
      At the time I contemplate the way that God made it <br />
      Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary <br />
      For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried <br />
      I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it
      <br />
      Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it <br />
      Witness the realest, a hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside <br />
      The cry from all your people when they find ya <br />
      Just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic <br />
      Revenge on them niggas that played me <br />
      And all the cowards that was down with it <br />
      Now it's your nigga right beside ya, hopin' you listenin' <br />
      Catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah <br />
      I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah <br />
      You don't wanna fuck with me <br />
      (My ambitions as a ridah) <br />
      Got the police bustin' at me <br />
      But they can't do nothin' to a G <br />
      I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah <br />
      You don't wanna fuck with me <br />
      Got the police bustin' at me <br />
      But they can't do nothin' to a G <br />

      <h2>Waiting for a Girl Like You</h2>
      <h3>Canção de Foreigner</h3>

      So long, I've been looking too hard <br />
      I've been waiting too long <br />
      Sometimes I don't know what I will find <br />
      I only know it's a matter of time <br />
      When you love someone <br />
      When you love someone <br />
      It feels so right, so warm and true <br />
      I need to know if you feel it too <br />
      Maybe I'm wrong <br />
      Won't you tell me if I'm coming on too strong? <br />
      This heart of mine has been hurt before <br />
      This time I want to be sure <br />
      I've been waiting for a girl like you to come into my life <br />
      I've been waiting for a girl like you, your a love that will survive
      <br />
      I've been waiting for someone new to make me feel alive <br />
      Yeah, waiting for a girl like you to come into my life <br />
      You're so good <br />
      When we make love it's understood <br />
      It's more than a touch or a word can say <br />
      Only in dreams could it be this way <br />
      When you love someone <br />
      Yeah, I really love someone <br />
      Now, I know it's right <br />
      From the moment I wake up 'til deep in the night <br />
      There's nowhere on earth that I'd rather be than holding you tenderly
      <br />
      I've been waiting for a girl like you to come into my life <br />
      I've been waiting for a girl like you, your a love that will survive
      <br />
      I've been waiting for someone new to make me feel alive <br />
      Yeah, waiting for a girl like you to come into my life <br />
      I've been waiting, waiting for you, ooh <br />
      Ooh, I've been waiting <br />
      (Waiting) I've been waiting, yeah <br />
      (I've been waiting for a girl like you, I've been waiting) <br />
      Won't you come into my life? <br />
      Ah <br />
